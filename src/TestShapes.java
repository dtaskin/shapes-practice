        This will be our actual program that we request some information from user to create 3 objects
        We will create 1 Rectangle, 1 Square and 1 Circle object

        Information to create objects will be as below
         -width of the rectangle = 5.5
         -height of the rectangle = 6
         -side of the square = 2.5
         -radius of the circle = 4


         Then print each object
         And print area and perimeters of each object
         Find and print the object which has the largest area

         EXPECTED OUTPUT:
         Circle{radius=4.0}
         Area of the Circle is = 50.24
         Perimeter of the Circle is = 25.12

         Rectangle{width=5.5, height=6.0}
         Area of the Rectangle is = 33.0
         Perimeter of the Rectangle is = 23.0

         Square{side=2.5}
         Area of the Square is = 6.25
         Perimeter of the Square is = 10.0

         Circle has the largest area as 50.24
